Note: This is a text file, not a binary image file.

You will need to manually create a simple placeholder image named 'placeholder.png' and place it in this location.

The placeholder should be:
1. Small in file size (under 10KB if possible)
2. Visually indicate that it's a placeholder for offline content
3. Match your site's color scheme

You can create a simple 400x300px image with text like "Image Unavailable Offline" using any image editor.

For a quick solution, you could use a service like https://placeholder.com/ to generate a placeholder and download it.

Example: https://via.placeholder.com/400x300/0f172a/f1f5f9?text=Offline+Image
